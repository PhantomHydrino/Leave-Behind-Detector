# Leave-Behind Detector

A React Native **Expo** app that reminds you to take your belongings before leaving a specific area.
It uses **device GPS** to monitor when you enter or exit saved locations and sends **local notifications** as a reminder.

## ‚ú® Features

* **Item Reminders**

  * Add, toggle, or delete items you never want to forget (e.g., *umbrella, charger*).
  * Clear all items with one tap.

* **Recover Items**

  * Enter the name of the missing item to view its most recent tracked locations, using the 'Recover Items' button.

* **Saved Places**

  * Add a place by manually entering latitude/longitude or by tapping **Detect Current Location** to auto-fill coordinates.
  * Specify a radius in meters for each place.
  * Delete individual locations or clear them all.

* **Geofence & Notifications**

  * Background location tracking with Expo Location.
  * Detects when you leave a saved area and sends a local notification listing the ‚Äúalways-remember‚Äù items.
  * Works in foreground or background; uses iOS/Android notification APIs.

* **Testing & Simulation**

  * **Test Reminder** button simulates leaving a location to verify notifications without physically moving.

* **User Feedback**

  * Toasts (via `react-native-toast-message`) for success/info messages such as ‚ÄúItem List Empty‚Äù or ‚ÄúNo Location Present.‚Äù

* **Cross-Platform Safe Area**

  * `react-native-safe-area-context` ensures UI looks correct on notched phones (iOS & Android).

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

1. **Start Tracking** ‚Äì Begins watching GPS position (`Location.watchPositionAsync`).
2. **Check Position** ‚Äì On every update, calculates distance to each saved place with the Haversine formula.
3. **Enter/Exit Detection** ‚Äì

   * When entering a place, sets `currentPlace` and session start time.
   * When leaving and if you stayed longer than the minimum session, calls `triggerReminder`.
4. **Trigger Reminder** ‚Äì Sends a local notification and shows an in-app alert listing all items marked `always: true`.

---

## üì± Permissions

* **Location** ‚Äì Required to detect when you leave a saved area.
* **Notifications** ‚Äì Required to deliver local reminders.

The app asks for permissions at runtime.

---

## üßë‚Äçüíª Development Notes

* Uses `SafeAreaView` with `edges={['top','bottom','left','right']}` for proper layout on devices with notches.
* All logic (state management, location watching, notifications) is contained in `App.tsx` for simplicity.
